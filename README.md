The LangLens project aims to create a cutting-edge mobile application that
utilizes OCR technology to recognize text in diverse scripts, including Latin,
Devanagari, and Korean. The primary focus is on providing users with a
seamless and efficient tool for capturing, translating, and understanding text in
different languages.
The scope includes the development of a robust OCR system capable of
accurately identifying characters in the specified scripts. Additionally, the app
will integrate a sophisticated translation engine to convert the recognized text
into the user's preferred language.
